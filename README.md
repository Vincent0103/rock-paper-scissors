# rock-paper-scissors

## Program
- The goal of the program is to make a simple game that many of us plays called: Rock, Paper, Scissors.
- Simple, you, the user/player, have to play against the computer in a round of the game by choosing between rock, paper, scissors (*obviously*) from an input textbox.
- No, websites or any styling here. Just a simple game prompted in the console.

## Change log
- Added ability for the computer to choose between 3 possibilities of rock, paper, scissors.
- Added rounds and win/lose/tie messages depending on the round.
